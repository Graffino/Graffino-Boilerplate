# Graffino Boilerplate

This repository contains a collection of configuration files. These settings include configuration files for linting, formatting, Git hooks, and more. To make it easy for others to use these settings, a Makefile is provided to download and initialize all the necessary files.

## Getting Started
To use these settings in your project follow these steps:

### Prerequisites
1. Prettier extension installed.
2. Eslint extension installed.

### Steps
1. In your root directory, create a `Makefile`. 
2. Copy the Makefile commands from this repository based on what project you want to use. (react folder for example)
4. Run in terminal `make init` to download the base configuration files.
5. Done.

##### At this moment only `react` and `next` projects are supported.
